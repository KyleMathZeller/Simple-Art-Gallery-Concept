# Simple-Art-Gallery-Concept
This is just a simple proof of concept for a web page that an Artist could host content on. It is an example of front-end web development work. I made this over a couple days mostly from scratch. For the majority of the art I used AI generated content to avoid the risk of infringing on copyrights. The images I use that are not AI generated are my background image which is free to use as well as the icon for the website. I have the sources listed below. Everything else is either a creation of AI of a mix of AI and my own personal work, again none of which is subject to copyright. Thank you for looking at my work.
