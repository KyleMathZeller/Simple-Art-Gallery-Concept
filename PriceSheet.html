            <h2 class="sectiontitle">Traditional Media Pricing</h2>
            <p class="blocktext">
                Traditional Media covers all the media made by hand. This includes paintings of watercolor and acrylic, 
                pencil drawings whether colored or simple line work. Anything make with chalk, or pastels. If more then 
                20% of your proposed project cannot be done on a computer consider it traditional media. This is more expensive
                for me to create versus digital art as everything must be done by hand on top of the fact that I need to  
                source the materials for the art. Canvas, pencils, paint, etc., your commission will not just include 
                my time like other mediums but also has to cover my costs of materials. If you are interested in a 
                particular style but the prices here are a bit out of your range consider if you idea can be converted 
                well into digital medium where software allows me to be more productive and materials are not added 
                onto the prices.<br><br><br>
                Pieces start for a 8" x 8" piece of medium with one subject in black and white, with a base price of <strong>$100</strong><br><br><br>
                Prices increase are at the artists discresion however generally speaking price increases are as follows:<br><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - coloring <strong>+$50-150</strong> (depnding on the medium this may be required ex. watercolors)</list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - additional subject <strong>+$50</strong> (per added subject)</list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - complex background <strong>+$50-$100</strong> (depending on complexity)</list><br><br>
                Be aware that prices are subject to change due to the estimated amount of labor the commission will take.

            <h2 class="sectiontitle">Digital Media Pricing</h2>
            <p class="blocktext">
                Digital Media covers anything that is flat art that can be created entirely on a computer that is not 
                animated nor needs to be viewed from multiple angles (see 3-D for these). Digital prices start cheaper 
                then traditional mediums due to no inital investment in materials. However, since the piece can be 
                used and replicated infinetly for the sake of fair use liscensing options for large scale use may be applied.<br><br><br>
                Pieces start for a 8" x 8" piece of medium with one subject in black and white, with a base price of <strong>$80</strong><br><br><br>
                Prices increase are at the artists discresion however generally speaking price increases are as follows:<br><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - coloring <strong>+$30-100</strong> (depnding on the medium this may be required ex. watercolors)</list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - additional subject <strong>+$40</strong> (per added subject)</list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - complex background <strong>+$25-$75</strong> (depending on complexity)</list><br><br>
                Be aware that prices are subject to change due to the estimated amount of labor the commission will take. <br><br>
                Unlimited replication of the art is not allowed. Commerical Licensing will be negotiated per comission 
                and replication of my are with out permission for advertising or commerical purposes violates my terms 
                of service and is not allowed. If you have questions reguarding this please feel free to reach out to me.

            <h2 class="sectiontitle">3-D Media Pricing</h2>
            <p class="blocktext">
                3-D media is anything that must be rendered from multiple angels or in a 2-D piece that is animated
                 (I.E. moves through time). This form of art is the most expensive because it generally just takes 
                 the most time. Animation is merely drawing the same drawing several times with mild variations to 
                 create movement. 3-D animation often needs to be considered from multiple side and therefore is like 
                 constructing the same piece from multiple angles layered on top of each other. 3-D art is often 
                 functional as well and that rapidly can increase the labor required. 3-D work includes simple colors 
                 for free but complex texture work increases depending on the commission, for example something being 
                 1080 is less work then creating something with 4k textures. <br><br><br>
                Pieces start one subject bust, with a base price of <strong>$500</strong><br><br><br>
                Prices increase are at the artists discresion however generally speaking price increases are as follows:<br><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - more complex coloring <strong>+$100-500</strong></list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - additional subject <strong>+$400</strong> (per added subject)</list><br>
                <list class="pricelist">
                - complex background <strong>+$500-1000</strong> (depending on complexity)</list><br><br>
                Be aware that prices are subject to change due to the estimated amount of labor the commission will 
                take. Because 3-D commissions for work varies so greatly please just ask. If you wanted something 
                simple like a visualizar scene for DJ's for example that could be even cheaper then listed. Thank you!
